# phase_folder
A package for phase folding tools. Developed for use with TESS light curves on Eclipsing Binary candidates

This package is functional, but it is also largely intended as a simple first-time package publication.
It is, perhaps, a better example of using jupyter widgets to create a functional interactive notebook
than a particularly robust phase folding algorithm.
